    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "A \"startup\" is typically characterized by its age, size, and funding method, though there isn't a strict definition. Generally, a startup is a young company, only a few years old, that hasn't yet achieved consistent revenue. These companies operate on a small scale, often with just a working prototype or a paid pilot, but they have the potential for rapid growth and expansion. Initially, they are funded by the founders' personal networks, including friends and family, and they actively seek additional financing to support their growth and establish a sustainable business.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, the Government of India’s Startup India program defines a “startup” as a company (PIB 2017) that is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Headquartered in India with not more than ten years since incorporation or registration\n",
    "   \n",
    "    2. Having an annual turnover of less than INR 1 billion (roughly $14 million) (Startup India 2019)\n",
    "\n",
    "`Available:` [ADBI Working Paper Series](https://www.adb.org/publications/startup-environment-and-funding-activity-india)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario\n",
    "Your team is trying to venture into the Indian start-up ecosystem. As the data expert of the team, you are to investigate the ecosystem and propose the best course of action. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "The primary objective is to analyse the funding landscape for start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021, focusing on identifying key trends and patterns. This analysis will provide crucial insights into the Indian start-up ecosystem, which will guide strategic decisions for entering and navigating the market effectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis: Influence of Top Investors\n",
    "\n",
    "**A. Rationale:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining the influence of top investors on the success of start-ups can provide insights into the impact of investor reputation and networks. This can guide new start-ups in selecting potential investors and understanding the benefits of partnering with top-tier investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**B. Null Hypothesis (H0):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Start-ups funded by top investors do not have higher subsequent funding rounds compared to those funded by less active investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**C. Alternative Hypothesis (H1):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Start-ups funded by top investors have higher subsequent funding rounds compared to those funded by less active investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Business Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Is there a correlation between funding amounts from top investors (blue-chip investors) and the performance metrics of start-ups?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploring the correlation between funding amounts from top investors and start-up performance metrics can help evaluate the effectiveness of investments made by these investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Who are the most active investors in the Indian start-up ecosystem?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying the most active investors can help in analyzing the influence of top investors on subsequent funding rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Are there any geographical trends or hotspots for start-up funding in India?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing geographical trends in start-up funding can provide context for understanding the influence of top investors in different regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Are there any annual trends in start-up funding in India from 2018 to 2021?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding annual trends in start-up funding can provide background information for assessing the impact of top investors on subsequent funding rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Which sectors received the most funding each year?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing the sectors that received the most funding can provide additional context for evaluating the influence of top investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. What impact do the years of existence or age of a start-up have on investment opportunities?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how the age of a start-up influences investment opportunities can provide insights into whether start-ups funded by top investors indeed have higher subsequent funding rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. What are the funding stages (seed, series A, etc.) that received the highest investments?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Examining the funding stages that received the highest investments can offer insights into the funding patterns of top investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "In conclusion, to understand the trends and patterns in start-up funding in India from 2018 to 2021, a comprehensive approach will be implemented. This will involve gathering detailed data on start-ups, funding amounts, stages, sectors, geographic locations, and investors. The collected data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics, trend analysis, visualizations, and statistical tests to derive key insights. These insights will be compiled into detailed reports and dashboards, providing actionable information and strategic recommendations. Ultimately, this analysis will offer data-driven guidance on the most promising sectors, regions, and funding stages to focus on, identify key investors for potential partnerships, and assess the overall attractiveness of the Indian start-up market for strategic entry."

    "\n",
    "`Data Collection`\n",
    "\n",
    "To effectively analyse the Indian start-up ecosystem from 2018 to 2021, comprehensive data collection is crucial. The data will be sourced from multiple datasets that detail startup funding activities within this period. Each dataset will encompass various aspects essential for a holistic understanding of the funding landscape. Specifically, the datasets will include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**A. Start-up Details:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Company/Brand: Name of the company/start-up\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Founded: Year start-up was founded\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Headquarters/Location: The geographical location of the start-up, including city and region.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Sector/Industry: The industry or sector in which the start-up operates, such as healthtech, fintech, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   What it does/About Company: Description about Company\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Founders: Founders of the Company\n",
    "\n",
    "**B. Funding Information:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Amount: The total amount of funding received by the start-up in each funding round.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Stage/Round: Details of the funding stages such as seed, series A, series B, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**C. Investors' Information:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Investors: The names of the investors or investment firms involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Data Quality Considerations`\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensuring high data quality is paramount for reliable analysis and actionable insights. Key considerations for maintaining data quality include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**A. Completeness:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that all necessary fields are filled in across the datasets. This includes making sure that no critical information is missing for any of the start-ups, funding rounds, or investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**B. Consistency:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Handle any inconsistencies in data entries. This may involve standardizing entries for sectors, locations, and investor names to ensure uniformity. For example, variations in how sectors are labeled (e.g., \"Healthtech\" vs. \"Health Technology\") should be standardized to a single format.\n",
    "\n",
    "**C. Handling Missing Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify and address missing data points. Techniques such as imputation, where appropriate, or excluding certain records if the missing data is minimal and does not impact overall analysis, will be employed."

    "\n",
    "`Data Cleaning`\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective data cleaning is crucial to ensure the integrity and usability of the dataset for analysis. The steps involved in data cleaning will include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**A. Remove Duplicates:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify and remove duplicate records to ensure that each entry is unique and not counted multiple times. This involves checking for repeated start-up names, funding amounts, and investor details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**B. Eliminate Irrelevant Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Remove any data that is not relevant to the analysis. This could include fields that do not contribute to the understanding of funding trends or extraneous information not related to start-up funding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**C. Handle Missing Values:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Imputation: For fields with missing data, use appropriate imputation methods to fill in the gaps. This could involve using mean, median, or mode for numerical values, or the most frequent category for categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Removal: If the amount of missing data is substantial and imputation is not feasible, records are removed entirely. However, this is done if deletion does not significantly impact the overall dataset integrity.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**D. Standardise Formats:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dates: Ensure all date fields follow a consistent format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD) to facilitate accurate time-based analysis.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Funding Amounts: Standardize funding amounts to a common currency and format, ensuring consistency in how values are presented and analysed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Categorical Variables: Ensure uniform labelling for categorical variables such as sectors, funding stages, and locations to avoid discrepancies (e.g., \"Health Care\" vs. \"Healthcare\").\n",
    "\n",
    "`Data Transformation`\n",
    "\n",
    "Data transformation involves modifying the data to better suit the analytical methods to be applied. The steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**A. Aggregate Funding Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- By Year: Summarize funding data on an annual basis to identify year-over-year trends in funding amounts and number of funding rounds.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- By Sector: Aggregate funding by sector to determine which industries are receiving the most investment.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- By Funding Stage: Summarize data by funding stage (e.g., seed, series A, series B) to understand the distribution of investments across different start-up maturity levels.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**B. Normalize Funding Amounts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjust funding amounts for inflation or currency changes over the years to ensure that comparisons are made on a like-for-like basis. This is important for accurately assessing trends and changes in funding amounts over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Data Integration`\n",
    "\n",
    "Data integration involves combining multiple datasets into a single, comprehensive dataset for analysis. This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**A. Combine Datasets from Different Years:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge datasets from 2018 to 2021 into a unified dataset. Ensure that the structure and format of data from each year are consistent to facilitate seamless integration. Address any discrepancies or differences in data schema across years to create a cohesive dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**B. Ensure Consistency:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Verify that all integrated data follows the standardized formats and labelling conventions established during the data cleaning process. Cross-reference and validate combined data to ensure no information is lost or misrepresented during the integration process."

    "\n",
    "The numerical values in the 'Amount' column exhibit outliers, making median imputation a more suitable method for addressing missing values. The robustness of the median against outliers ensures that the imputation process is not skewed by extreme values, thus preserving the dataset's integrity. Furthermore, distinct median values observed across different stages support the preference for median imputation, as it accurately reflects the central tendency within each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the imputation strategy is designed to fill missing values in the stage column with stage groups based on the median values derived from each stage, which differs from using the mode of the stage column to fill missing values, a common approach for categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, if the 'Amount' data were devoid of outliers, mean imputation would be appropriate for handling missing numerical values due to its simplicity and effectiveness in symmetrical distributions. As mentioned earlier for categorical data, mode imputation would be the preferred method, utilizing the most frequently occurring category to maintain the distributional characteristics of the dataset. Although the calculated mean and mode values illustrate these alternative methods, given the current data characteristics, median imputation remains the optimal choice."

    "In the task of filling missing values in the 'Amount' column, multiple imputation emerges as a superior choice over KNN imputation due to its robustness, adaptability, and modeling capabilities. Multiple imputation, by modeling the entire distribution of the data, exhibits heightened resilience to outliers compared to KNN imputation, which is sensitive to outlier influence owing to its reliance on distance metrics. Furthermore, the suitability of multiple imputation extends to scenarios where missing data follows either a missing at random (MAR) or missing completely at random (MCAR) pattern, as it can effectively model various missing data mechanisms using observed data. In contrast, while KNN imputation excels in scenarios of localized missing data patterns, its assumption of local similarity may lead to suboptimal imputations in more complex or non-localized missing data scenarios."
